# An Introduction to Probability and Statistics  {#cha-introps}

This chapter has proved to be the hardest to write, by far. The
trouble is that there is so much to say -- and so many people have
already said it so much better than I could. When I get something I
like I will release it here.

In the meantime, there is a lot of information already available to a
person with an Internet connection. I recommend to start at Wikipedia,
which is not a flawless resource but it has the main ideas with links
to reputable sources.

In my lectures I usually tell stories about Fisher, Galton, Gauss,
Laplace, Quetelet, and the Chevalier de Mere.

## Probability

The common folklore is that probability has been around for millennia
but did not gain the attention of mathematicians until approximately
1654 when the Chevalier de Mere had a question regarding the fair
division of a game's payoff to the two players, supposing the game had
to end prematurely.

## Statistics

Statistics concerns data; their collection, analysis, and
interpretation. In this book we distinguish between two types of
statistics: descriptive and inferential.

Descriptive statistics concerns the summarization of data. We have a
data set and we would like to describe the data set in multiple
ways. Usually this entails calculating numbers from the data, called
descriptive measures, such as percentages, sums, averages, and so
forth.

Inferential statistics does more. There is an inference associated
with the data set, a conclusion drawn about the population from which
the data originated.

There are two schools of thought regarding
statistics: frequentist and bayesian. The difference between the
schools is related to how the two groups interpret the underlying
probability (see Section \@ref(sec-interpreting-probabilities)). The frequentist
school gained a lot of ground among statisticians due in large part to
the work of Fisher, Neyman, and Pearson in the early twentieth
century. That dominance lasted until inexpensive computing power
became widely available; nowadays the bayesian school is garnering
more attention and at an increasing rate.

This book is devoted mostly to the frequentist viewpoint because that
is how I was trained, with the conspicuous exception of Sections
\@ref(sec-bayes-rule) and \@ref(sec-conditional-distributions).
